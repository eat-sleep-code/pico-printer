# pico-printer
A completely ridiculous project to build a small mostly-printed 3D printer that uses very cheap components.

The bill of materials (BOM) STL files and STEP files will be added when (and if) a working prototype is completed.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- TBD

### Software

Execute the following to install the required non-standard Python libraries

```
pip install adafruit-circuitpython-sdcard
pip install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306
```
